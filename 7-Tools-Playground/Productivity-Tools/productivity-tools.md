## Tool Selection Guidelines

### For Solo Developers
- **Start with**: Notion (notes/tasks), Toggl (time tracking), Loom (communication)
- **Focus on**: Tools that don't require team coordination
- **Avoid**: Enterprise tools with team-focused pricing

### For Small Teams (2-10 people)
- **Core Stack**: Slack/Discord (communication), Linear/Trello (project management), Figma (design)
- **Add gradually**: Zapier (automation), GitBook (documentation)
- **Consider**: Free tiers and per-user costs

### For Growing Teams (10+ people)
- **Invest in**: Proper project management (Linear, Jira), documentation (Confluence, GitBook)
- **Standardize**: Communication tools and file sharing
- **Automate**: Repetitive workflows with Zapier or GitHub Actions

### Integration Considerations
- **Choose ecosystems**: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, or Atlassian suite
- **Prioritize**: Tools that integrate well with your existing stack
- **Avoid**: Tool sprawl that creates context switching overhead
