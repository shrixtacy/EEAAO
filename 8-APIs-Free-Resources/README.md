- **Documentation Quality**: How well the API is documented
- **Reliability**: Uptime and maintenance status
- **Use Cases**: Practical applications and project ideas

## Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations
- Most free APIs have rate limits
- Some require registration or API keys
- Quality and uptime may vary
- Commercial use restrictions may apply

### Best Practices
- Always check terms of service
- Implement proper error handling
- Cache responses when possible
- Have backup plans for critical dependencies

### Learning Focus
These resources are selected for their educational value and ease of use. They're perfect for:
- Building portfolio projects
- Learning API integration
- Prototyping new ideas
- Practicing data analysis

## Getting Started

1. **Browse by Category**: Find APIs that match your project needs
2. **Check Requirements**: Note any registration or authentication needs
3. **Read Documentation**: Understand endpoints and data formats
4. **Start Small**: Begin with simple requests before building complex integrations
5. **Plan for Limits**: Design your application around rate limits and quotas

Remember: Free resources are perfect for learning and prototyping, but consider paid alternatives for production applications that need guaranteed uptime and higher limits.
