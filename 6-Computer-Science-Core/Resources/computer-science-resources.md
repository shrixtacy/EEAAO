# Computer Science Learning Resources

## Overview

This comprehensive guide provides curated learning resources for computer science fundamentals. Resources are organized by topic and include free/paid options, time commitments, and skill level requirements.

**Learning Philosophy**: Start with practical applications, then dive into theory when you need it. Don't learn CS concepts in isolation - always connect them to real-world problems you're trying to solve.

## Success Tips

### 1. Start with Problems, Not Theory
- Build something that's slow → Learn why it's slow → Study algorithms
- Don't learn sorting algorithms until you need to sort something

### 2. Use the 80/20 Rule
- 80% of CS jobs use 20% of CS theory
- Focus on: Arrays, Hash Tables, Basic Algorithms, System Design Basics
- Skip: Advanced graph theory, complex mathematical proofs

### 3. Learn Actively
- Implement algorithms from scratch
- Explain concepts to others
- Apply learning to real projects immediately

### 4. Track Your Progress
- Keep a learning journal
- Build a portfolio of projects that demonstrate CS concepts
- Measure improvement through coding challenges

### 5. Join Communities
- **Reddit**: r/cscareerquestions, r/algorithms
- **Discord**: Various CS learning servers
- **Local Meetups**: Algorithm study groups, CS meetups

Remember: The goal isn't to become a computer scientist unless that's your specific career path. The goal is to become a better developer by understanding the tools and concepts that help you build better software.
