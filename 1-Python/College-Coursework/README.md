## 🎯 Learning Approach

Each topic in this coursework follows a structured approach:

1. **Comprehensive Theory** - Deep explanations of concepts, why they matter, and how they work
2. **Practical Examples** - Real-world code examples demonstrating the concepts
3. **Two Key Questions** - The most important questions for each topic with detailed answers
4. **Exam Preparation** - Focus on understanding rather than memorization

## 📝 How to Use This Guide

1. **Read the Theory First** - Understand the "why" before the "how"
2. **Study the Examples** - Type out the code yourself, don't just read it
3. **Answer the Questions** - Try to answer before reading the provided answers
4. **Practice Regularly** - Programming is learned by doing
5. **Review Frequently** - Revisit topics to reinforce understanding
