### Success Tips
1. **Start Smaller**: Better to complete a simple version than abandon a complex one
2. **Document Everything**: Write README files and comment your code
3. **Deploy Early**: Get your projects online for others to see
4. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Show your work and improve based on input
5. **Focus on Completion**: Finished projects are more valuable than perfect ones

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Feature Creep**: Stick to your planned scope
- **Perfectionism**: Ship the minimum viable version first
- **Tutorial Hell**: Build original projects, don't just follow tutorials
- **Isolation**: Share your work and get feedback from others

Remember: The goal is to build something that demonstrates your ability to solve real problems with code. Focus on creating value for users, even if they're just friends and family initially.
